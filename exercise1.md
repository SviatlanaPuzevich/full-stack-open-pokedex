In CI (Continuous Integration) processes, one of the key stages is linting, which helps analyze code, prevent errors, and maintain a consistent code style. The most popular tool for this purpose is ESLint.

For unit testing in JavaScript projects, tools like Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, and Karma are commonly used. For integration and end-to-end testing, popular choices include Cypress, Playwright, and Selenium.

JavaScript project builds in CI pipelines are typically automated using platforms such as Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, Travis CI, and TeamCity. These tools offer robust features for automating build, test, and deployment processes, suitable for teams of all sizes.

Jenkins is considered a pioneer in the CI/CD space. It's an open-source server that allows you to set up pipelines for building, testing, and deploying applications. One of its main strengths is the vast plugin ecosystem. However, there are now many alternatives, each suited to different environments and project needs.

For example, GitHub Actions is deeply integrated with GitHub repositories, making it an excellent choice for teams already using GitHub.
Travis CI is a cloud-based service optimized for GitHub, offering commercial support.

GitLab CI/CD is a built-in automation system in GitLab for building, testing, and deploying code. It supports Docker, scalable runners, parallel job execution, and DAG-based job dependencies. The platform is also known for its strong security features.

However, GitLab CI/CD has some limitations, such as the need to manually upload/download artifacts, lack of support for pre-merge testing, and no support for stages within phases.

The choice between self-hosted and cloud-based CI/CD solutions depends on the project and team needs. Cloud services are easy to set up, require no infrastructure maintenance, and are quick to start using. However, for more complex projects that require fine-tuned configuration or specific tasks, a self-hosted solution may be more appropriate.
